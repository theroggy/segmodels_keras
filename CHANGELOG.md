# Change Log

### segmodels_keras

**Version 0.1.0**

###### Deprecation info
 - Package renamed to `segmodels_keras` to make it clear it isn't the same library
   (#1, #3)
 - Support of keras v1 was dropped.
 - Support for following backbones was dropped:
     - seresnet18, seresnet34, seresnet101, seresnet152
     - seresnext50, seresnext101, senet154
 - For resnet50, resnet101 and resnet152 the implementation was changed to use
   keras.applications where the models are implemented slightly different, so weights
   for the "old" models or for segmentation models based on those models will not be
   compatible anymore.
 - For resnet18 and resnet34 the implementation was changed so it is similar to
   keras.applications and compatible with the torchvision of these models. This means
   weights for the "old" models or for segmentation models based on those models will
   not be compatible anymore. In addition, there are no "imagenet" weights available
   anymore for these models.

###### Areas of improvement
 - Add extra backbones: resnet50v2, resnet101v2, resnet152v2 and efficientnetv2m (#6)
 - Add support for keras v3 (#5)
 - Add support to provide weights without top when creating a model (#19)
 - Add support to freeze all layers except for the top layers (#24)
 - Add `utils.load_weights` that also supports loading weights that were saved to .h in
   keras 3 in keras <= 2.11 (#28, #31).
 - Use implementation + weights of keras.applications for inceptionresnetv2 and just
   retain the customizations needed for the skip connections (#13, #14)
 - General code improvements by applying ruff, add type hints,... (#4, #30)

### segmentation_models

**Version 1.0.0**

###### Areas of improvement
 - Support for `keras` and `tf.keras`
 - Losses as classes, base loss operations (sum of losses, multiplied loss)
 - NCHW and NHWC support
 - Removed pure tf operations to work with other keras backends
 - Reduced a number of custom objects for better models serialization and deserialization

###### New featrues
 - New backbones: EfficentNetB[0-7] 
 - New loss function: Focal loss 
 - New metrics: Precision, Recall
 
###### API changes
 - `get_preprocessing` moved from `sm.backbones.get_preprocessing` to `sm.get_preprocessing`

**Version 0.2.1** 

###### Areas of improvement

 - Added `set_regularization` function 
 - Added `beta` argument to dice loss
 - Added `threshold` argument for metrics
 - Fixed `prerprocess_input` for mobilenets
 - Fixed missing parameter `interpolation` in `ResizeImage` layer config
 - Some minor improvements in docs, fixed typos

**Version 0.2.0** 

###### Areas of improvement

 - New backbones (SE-ResNets, SE-ResNeXts, SENet154, MobileNets)
 - Metrcis:  
    - `iou_score` / `jaccard_score`
    - `f_score` / `dice_score`
 - Losses:  
    - `jaccard_loss` 
    - `bce_jaccard_loss`
    - `cce_jaccard_loss`
    - `dice_loss`
    - `bce_dice_loss`
    - `cce_dice_loss`
  - Documentation [Read the Docs](https://segmentation-models.readthedocs.io)
  - Tests + Travis-CI 
    
###### API changes

 - Some parameters renamed (see API docs)
 - `encoder_freeze=True` does not `freeze` BatchNormalization layer of encoder
